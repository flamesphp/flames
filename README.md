## About Flames

**Flames** is a **PHP framework** for frontend, backend, console applications and a set
of **PHP components**.

Why should I migrate to the Flames?
------------

* Framework created for high performance and large number of accesses.
* You don't need to learn JS to develop your frontend, just run PHP natively on it.

----
*Flames was developed from scratch, with the aim of replacing the legacy KrupaBOX private framework, used in several banks, large streaming platforms and government agencies. Now in an open-source way.*
